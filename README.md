- If there's still problems, there's could be a lot of complicated reasons.
- I only fork and complile sources that are not closed-sources.
- I only accept reported issues with LOGCAT files and other simliar if is better, otherwise will be ignored and/or closed.
- I will try to keep module up-to-date as possible and you can support if you want, but yet I'm doing all this just for free, not like I'm being paid.
