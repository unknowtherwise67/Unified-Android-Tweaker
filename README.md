## CAUTIONS
- Don't install with any tweaks or mods relative root modules as it can cause conflicts.

## TROUBLESHOOTS - IF PROBLEMS OCCURED:
- Remove Thermal Modification by unpack, remove "system" folder and repack and reinstall.
- Turn off the device, keep holding power button until it bootup twice and all Root Module will be automatically removed by Root (Magisk, KernelSU, etc).

## NOTES
- If you want Root Module not to modify any user system settings except others, unpack the Root Module and delete "system_settings.sh". Then save it and repack it before installations.
- I only accept reported issues with logcats files and other similar if is better, otherwise will be ignored and/or closed.
- I will try to keep module up-to-date as possible and you can support if you want, but yet I'm doing all this just for free and I'm being paid for it.
- I do not and never publish repositories and releases to any other websites such as Androidacy.
- If you do like my work, buy me a coffee or donate and I'll thank you later. :D
- You are free to fork the repository, but please MAKE SURE to add CREDITS or get rekt and don't forget to extract any archives that may necessary.
