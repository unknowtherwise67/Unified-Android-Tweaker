## DISCLAMERS
- USE THE ROOT MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISKS.
- DEVELOPERS ARE DO NOT TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYHING THAT HAPPENS ONLY IF IS YOUR FAULTS.

## REQUIREMENTS/COMPATIBILITY
- ANDROID 6 and/or Above.
- Linux Kernel 3 and/or Above.
- UNLOCKED BOOTLOADER and Installed ROOT (Magisk - Version 20 and Above, KernelSU, etc).
- Zygisk or similar supports if its better (Optional).
- Knowledges of technologies and experiences.
- Should work but only on any Android devices.

## INSTALLATIONS
1. Install in Magisk, KernelSU, etc.
2. Reboot.
5. Have fun. :)

## CAUTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTS
- Do not use other, similar Root Module that is not legit or verified by developer.
- Do not install with any tweaks or mods relative modules as it can cause conflicts.
- If you had any problems after installed the module, try these methods (or its not even work then there could a lot of reasons):
- Uninstall, Reboot/Restart and Reinstall the Root Module
- (Use this method In case the Device is in Bootlooping - mean infinite OS logo loading period, longer than expected) Shutdown and Boot, during the Device is booting, press and hold combination buttons (Depends on Device) until force Reboot/Restart the device itself, then do this at least 2 time, in this way, Root (Magisk, KSU, etc) will disable all installed Root Module and other features like Zygisk, etc.

## NOTES
- I only accept reported issues with LOGCAT files and other simliar if is better, otherwise will be ignored and/or closed.
- I will try to keep module up-to-date as possible and you can support if you want, but yet I'm doing all this just for free, not like I'm being paid.
- I DO NOT and NEVER publish repositories and releases to any other websites such as Androidacy.
- If you do like my work, buy me a coffee or donate, I'll thank you later. :D
- You are free to fork the repository, but please MAKE SURE to add CREDITS or get rekt and don't forget to extract any archives that may necessary.
