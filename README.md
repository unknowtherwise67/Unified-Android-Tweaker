## REQUIREMENTS/COMPATIBILITY

- UNLOCKED BOOTLOADER and Installed ROOT (Magisk - Version 20 and Above, KernelSU, etc).
- Zygisk or similar supports if its better (Optional).

- Should work and only on any Android devices.

## INSTALLATIONS
1. Install in Magisk, KernelSU, etc.
2. Reboot.
5. Have fun. :)

## CAUTIONS
- Do not install with any tweaks or mods relative root modules as it can cause conflicts.

## TROUBLESHOOTS
- If you had any problems after installed the module, try this methods (or its not even work then there could a lot of reasons): Shutdown and Boot, during the Device is booting, press and hold combination buttons (Depends on the device) until it force Reboot/Restart the device itself, then do this at least 2-3 time, in this way, Root (Magisk, KSU, etc) will auto disable all installed Root Module and other features like Zygisk, etc.

## NOTES
- If you want Root Module not to modify any user system settings except others, unpack the Root Module and delete "system_settings.sh". Then save it and repack it before installations.
- I only accept reported issues with LOGCAT files and other similar if is better, otherwise will be ignored and/or closed.
- I will try to keep module up-to-date as possible and you can support if you want, but yet I'm doing all this just for free and I'm being paid for it.
- I do not and never publish repositories and releases to any other websites such as Androidacy.
- If you do like my work, buy me a coffee or donate and I'll thank you later. :D
- You are free to fork the repository, but please MAKE SURE to add CREDITS or get rekt and don't forget to extract any archives that may necessary.
